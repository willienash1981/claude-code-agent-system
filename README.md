- **Production-Like Data** - Complex, realistic test scenarios that expose edge cases
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Intelligent visual regression detection with <5% false positives
- **Integration State Testing** - Third-party APIs (QuickBooks, Salesforce) with real data patterns
- **Performance Impact Assessment** - Visual changes effect on app performance
- **Console & Network Monitoring** - Comprehensive error detection during UI testing

**Workflow**:
1. **Authentication & Data Setup** - Real OAuth flows and production-complexity data
2. **Systematic Testing** - AI-powered UI exploration with monitoring
3. **Analysis & Validation** - Intelligent visual regression analysis and performance assessment

### **🔄 How It Works**
The `/maintenance` command executes:
- **best-practices-researcher** finds latest improvements  
- **agent-observability-platform** performs comprehensive health assessment
- **system-evaluator** validates all changes (CRITICAL SAFETY GATE)
- **agent-ecosystem-manager** coordinates system updates
- **meta-agent-creator** builds new agents for approved gaps
- **agent-tester** validates all changes
- Updates are tested, documented, and released automatically

### **🛡️ Safety Features**
- ✅ **system-evaluator** prevents breaking changes
- ✅ **governance-agent** enforces constitutional compliance
- ✅ Human-triggered with full oversight
- ✅ Common sense validation for all proposals
- ✅ No redundant capabilities - uses existing agents
- ✅ Rollback capability if issues arise

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/willienash1981/claude-code-agent-system.git
cd claude-code-agent-system
```

2. Run the installation script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

3. Verify installation:
```bash
./verify_installation.sh
```

### Basic Usage

Always start with the agent-selector:

```
"Use agent-selector to build a React dashboard with authentication"
```

The agent-selector will:
1. Dynamically discover all 69+ available agents
2. Analyze your requirements
3. Recommend the optimal workflow
4. Suggest specific agents and execution order
5. Estimate time and token usage
6. Provide alternatives if available
