Master Claude Code Sub-Agent System - Complete Production Guide

This is the definitive, production-ready sub-agent ecosystem for Claude Code. It combines sophisticated orchestration, specialized expertise, automated quality gates, and enterprise-grade monitoring into a unified system covering the complete software development lifecycle.

🧠 Model Selection Guidelines - Four-Tier System

Claude Code sub-agents use a sophisticated four-tiered approach for optimal performance and cost efficiency:
	•	Tier 1: Default Workhorse (Sonnet 4)
	◦	Model: claude-sonnet-4-latest
	◦	Usage: 80%+ of standard development tasks.
	◦	Examples: Documentation, standard coding, routine testing.
	•	Tier 2: Critical Reasoning (Opus 4)
	◦	Model: claude-opus-4-latest
	◦	Usage: High-stakes decisions where errors are costly.
	◦	Examples: Orchestration, security audits, incident response, complex debugging.
	•	Tier 3: Dynamic Escalation ("Extended Thinking")
	◦	Triggers: Complexity detection in agent logic.
	◦	Commands: "think", "think hard", "think harder", "ultrathink"
	◦	Usage: On-demand performance boost without permanent Opus assignment.
	◦	Example: backend-developer encountering complex cryptographic implementation.
	•	Tier 4: Cost-Saving Delegation
	◦	External Models: Gemini (free tier), Codex.
	◦	Usage: Token-intensive but computationally simple tasks.
	◦	Examples: Large file analysis, bulk summarization, pattern matching.

🏗️ Advanced Architectural Paradigms

	•	Hierarchical Orchestration ("AgentOrchestra" Model)
	◦	Top-level planning agent decomposes objectives.
	◦	Sub-tasks delegated to specialized workers.
	◦	Built-in review and validation steps.
	◦	governance-agent validates plans before execution.
	•	Dynamic Orchestration ("Puppeteer" Model)
	◦	Central orchestrator makes real-time decisions.
	◦	Learning from past outcomes via reinforcement.
	◦	Compact, effective reasoning pathways.
	◦	Emergent collective problem-solving.
	•	Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
	◦	Combines structured planning with dynamic adaptation.
	◦	project-planner creates detailed upfront plans.
	◦	master-orchestrator acts as dynamic "Puppeteer".
	◦	Resilient to unexpected challenges while maintaining structure.

## 🔄 Agent Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Pipeline
```
requirements → architecture → development → testing → deployment
```

### Parallel Execution
```
┌─ frontend-developer ─┐
├─ backend-developer  ─┼─→ integration
└─ database-architect ─┘
```

### Quality Feedback Loop
```
developer → pre-commit → code-review → security-audit → production
```

## 🛡️ Governance & Compliance

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Enforcement
The governance-agent enforces mandatory human approval for:

1. **Production Operations**
   - Any deployment to production
   - Database migrations
   - Infrastructure changes

2. **Security-Sensitive Actions**
   - Commands with sudo/root
   - Secret management
   - Firewall modifications

3. **Financial Operations**
   - Payment API interactions
   - Billing modifications
   - Cost threshold breaches

4. **Quality Overrides**
   - Reducing test coverage
   - Disabling security scans
   - Bypassing quality gates

## 🚀 Best Practices

### Strategic Implementation
1. **Start with agent-selector** - Let it recommend the right workflow
2. **Use context-optimizer** - Monitor token usage proactively
3. **Enable governance-agent** - Ensure compliance and security
4. **Leverage parallel execution** - Speed up with multiple agents
5. **Implement quality gates** - Maintain high standards

### Token Optimization
1. **Delegate large files** - Use Gemini for files >500 lines
2. **Compress context** - Use context-optimizer regularly
3. **Cache results** - Avoid redundant operations
4. **Use Files API** - Store artifacts persistently

### Monitoring & Maintenance
1. **Daily metrics review** - Check agent-metrics-dashboard
2. **Weekly performance analysis** - Review efficiency scores
3. **Monthly optimization** - Update underperforming agents
4. **Continuous testing** - Run agent-tester regularly

## 🔧 MCP Integration

Essential Model Context Protocol servers:

```bash
# context7 - Latest documentation (MANDATORY)
npx @mendable/context7-mcp

# Playwright - Browser automation
npx @antiwork/playwright-mcp

# Firecrawl - Web scraping
npx @mendable/firecrawl-mcp
```

## 📈 Quality Gates Configuration

```yaml
quality_gates:
  planning:
    threshold: 85
    required_agents: ["requirements-analyst", "system-architect"]
  development:
    threshold: 88
    required_agents: ["test-automator", "code-reviewer"]
  deployment:
    threshold: 90
    required_agents: ["security-auditor", "sre-specialist"]
```

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Finding Agents
```bash
# Discover agents for your task
agent-selector "describe your project"

# List all available agents
agent-list

# Get info about specific agent
agent-info frontend-developer

# Check agent version
agent-version backend-developer
```

### Running Workflows
```bash
# Full-stack web application
run-webapp "Create SaaS dashboard"

# Mobile application
run-mobile "Build fitness tracking app"

# Emergency hotfix
run-hotfix "Fix production database issue"
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Live dashboard
watch-agents

# Cost analysis
agent-cost today

# Performance metrics
agent-stats

# Health check
agent-health
```

## 📝 CLAUDE.md Configuration

The CLAUDE.md file serves as the project's constitution with mandatory rules:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md - Project Constitution

## CRITICAL AGENT RULES

### File Size Delegation
MANDATORY: For ANY file exceeding 500 lines:
1. You MUST use the Gemini delegation pattern
2. Do NOT read the file directly
3. Execute: `./hooks/delegate_task.sh <filename>`

### Quality Gates
All code changes MUST pass:
- Unit test coverage >= 80%
- Security scan (via security-auditor)
- Code review (multi-perspective)

### Model Escalation
When detecting high complexity:
1. Add "think harder" to your reasoning
2. For critical decisions, add "ultrathink"
3. Request one-time Opus 4.1 access if needed

### Human-in-the-Loop Triggers
The following ALWAYS require human approval:
1. Production deployments
2. Database schema changes
3. Financial transactions
4. Sudo/root commands
5. Reducing test coverage
```

       solutions = research_solutions(issues)
       test_and_implement(solutions)
       update_documentation()
       sleep(weekly)
   ```
