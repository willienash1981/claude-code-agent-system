# Master-Orchestrator Circuit Breaker Test

## Problem Statement
The master-orchestrator was taking over execution instead of creating delegation plans. Even with strong constraints, it would attempt to do the work itself rather than delegating to specific sub-agents.

## Solution: Circuit Breaker Pattern
Implemented a "circuit breaker" that immediately halts execution and forces YAML-only output mode.

## Test Case
**Command**: `Use master-orchestrator: "Create a sub agent plan to fully map the report generation process..."`

## Expected Behavior
Should return YAML like this:

```yaml
circuit_breaker_status: ACTIVE
execution_blocked: true
user_request: "Map report generation process from QB data flagging to audit report viewing"
agents_available: 74

delegation_workflow:
  overview: "Complete system mapping requires multiple specialized agents"
  execution_method: "MANUAL - Use each agent command below in sequence"
  
  step_sequence:
    - step: 1
      agent_name: "system-architect"
      task_description: "Analyze and map the overall system architecture"
      command_to_execute: "Use system-architect: Map the complete report generation system from QB data flagging to audit page report viewing"
      expected_deliverable: "System architecture diagram and component mapping"
      
    - step: 2
      agent_name: "data-engineer"
      task_description: "Map data flow and transformations"
      command_to_execute: "Use data-engineer: Document the complete data flow from QB flagging through report generation"
      expected_deliverable: "Data flow diagram and transformation documentation"
      depends_on: "step 1 completion"
```

## Key Verification Points
1. ✅ Returns YAML format only
2. ✅ Includes circuit_breaker_status: ACTIVE
3. ✅ Specifies exact agent names for each step
4. ✅ Provides manual execution commands
5. ✅ Does not attempt to execute any tasks itself
6. ✅ Does not create files or perform analysis

## If Test Fails
The circuit breaker pattern should prevent execution entirely. If it still attempts to do work instead of delegating, there may be a deeper issue with Claude Code's agent constraint handling.

## Debugging Steps
1. Check if agent discovery runs (should show agents_available count)
2. Verify YAML-only output format
3. Confirm no file creation or analysis attempts
4. Look for manual execution commands in output

## Backup Plan
If circuit breaker fails, we may need to:
1. Create a wrapper agent that calls master-orchestrator
2. Use a different tool configuration
3. Implement agent constraints at the system level
4. Consider a different architectural approach
