# Master-Orchestrator Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed
The master-orchestrator was sometimes creating plans but not always specifying which sub-agents should handle each task, causing the standard Claude Code session to take over execution instead of delegating to specialized agents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Strengthened Behavioral Constraints
- Added explicit "I AM A DELEGATION PLANNER ONLY" identity
- Listed absolute prohibitions on execution
- Added emergency behavior section to prevent takeover

### 2. Simplified YAML Format  
- Removed complex orchestration patterns that caused confusion
- Made agent assignment mandatory for every step
- Added explicit "prompt" field with exact instructions for each agent
- Included manual execution instructions

### 3. Rigid Process Enforcement
- Made agent discovery mandatory at start of every request
- Required YAML-only responses with no other text
- Added identity reinforcement throughout

## Test Commands

To verify the fix works, try these test prompts:

```bash
# Test 1: Simple multi-step task
Use master-orchestrator: "Create a web application with authentication"

# Test 2: Complex system task  
Use master-orchestrator: "Analyze and improve the agent system performance"

# Test 3: Emergency scenario
Use master-orchestrator: "Debug and fix a critical production issue"
```

## Expected Behavior
- Should ALWAYS return YAML workflow plans
- Should NEVER attempt execution itself
- Should specify exact agents for each step
- Should include specific prompts for manual execution
- Should discover available agents before planning

## Key Verification Points
1. Does it discover agents using list_directory?
2. Does it return ONLY YAML format?
3. Does each step specify an exact agent name?
4. Does it include manual execution instructions?
5. Does it never attempt to execute tasks itself?

## Backup Plan
If issues persist, the original file is backed up at:

The fix is committed as: "Fix: Strengthen master-orchestrator delegation constraints"
