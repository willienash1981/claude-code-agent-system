# System Maintenance Workflow

Execute complete system maintenance workflow using existing agents in sequence to maintain and update the agent system.

## Instructions

**Phase 1: Research & Analysis**
1. **best-practices-researcher** - Research latest development trends, tools, and patterns that could improve our agent system
2. **agent-observability-platform** - Analyze current system performance, agent success rates, and identify bottlenecks

**Phase 2: Planning & Coordination**
3. **agent-ecosystem-manager** - Review research findings and performance data, create improvement plan
4. **meta-agent-creator** - Identify gaps where new agents are needed based on improvement plan
5. **system-evaluator** - Apply common sense validation to all proposed changes and improvements (CRITICAL SAFETY GATE)

**Phase 3: Implementation (APPROVED CHANGES ONLY)**
6. **prompt-engineer** - Optimize existing agent prompts based on APPROVED improvements only
7. **meta-agent-creator** - Create APPROVED new agents only (rejected proposals are not implemented)
8. **code-reviewer** - Review all APPROVED agent modifications for quality and consistency

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**
9. **agent-tester** - Test all APPROVED modified and new agents for functionality
10. **agent-ecosystem-manager** - Deploy APPROVED and TESTED changes, update system documentation, commit changes, and create release

## Expected Results
- System updated with latest industry best practices
- Performance bottlenecks identified and resolved
- New agents created for identified capability gaps
- Existing agents optimized and improved
- Documentation updated and system released to GitHub
- All changes tested and validated

**Duration**: 30-60 minutes | **Cost**: $2-4 in tokens

**Safety**: system-evaluator acts as critical safety gate preventing breaking changes
