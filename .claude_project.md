# Claude Code Project File - Agent System Management

## Quick Context
You're managing the Claude Code Agent System - a self-maintaining orchestration system with 66+ specialized agents. The system is installed at `~/.claude/` and the Git repository is at `~/Desktop/claude-code-agent-system/`.

## Essential Information
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/willienash1981/claude-code-agent-system
- **Version**: v2.2.0
- **Key Rule**: agent-selector ONLY gives recommendations, never executes tasks

## File Paths
```
~/.claude/                          # Test changes here
~/Desktop/claude-code-agent-system/ # Then copy here for Git
```

## Common Commands
```bash
# Test agent
"Use [agent-name] to [task]"

# Navigate to repo
cd ~/Desktop/claude-code-agent-system

# Commit changes
git add -A && git commit -m "message" && git push

# Verify system
./verify_installation.sh
```

## Workflow for Changes
1. Edit in `~/.claude/[component]`
2. Test locally
3. Copy to `~/Desktop/claude-code-agent-system/`
4. Git commit and push

## Critical Files
- `agents/agent-selector.md` - Must only recommend
- `knowledge/workflows.json` - Workflow patterns
- `docs/SYSTEM_MASTER_PLAN.md` - Full documentation

## Remember
- Test before committing
- No personal info in commits
- agent-selector returns YAML only
- Keep both paths synchronized
