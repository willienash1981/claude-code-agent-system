# Agent Relationships and Dependencies

## Sequential Dependencies (MUST follow order)

### Mobile Development Pipeline
1. mobile-ux-engineer → Creates structure WITHOUT styling
2. mobile-ui-implementer → Adds visual design to UX structure
3. html-to-native-converter → Converts to native code

### Planning to Implementation
1. requirements-analyst → Defines what to build
2. system-architect → Defines how to build
3. api-architect → Defines contracts
4. Implementation agents → Build according to specs

## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- frontend-developer + backend-developer + database-architect
- code-reviewer + security-auditor + accessibility-auditor
- Multiple mobile-ui-implementer for different themes

## Meta-Agent Hierarchy
1. agent-ecosystem-manager - Supreme authority, maintains everything
2. master-orchestrator - Project coordination
3. agent-selector - Agent discovery and recommendation
4. governance-agent - Policy enforcement
